Although George Michael had only got to second base, he\'d gone in head first, like Pete Rose. It\'s a jetpack, Michael. What could possibly go wrong? I\'m gonna build me an airport, put my name on it. Why, Michael? So you can fly away from your feelings? Why are you squeezing me with your body? It\'s a hug, Michael. I\'m hugging you",
