It seems like only yesterday you were bursting forth from your mother\'s fertile womb. I know she\'s a brownish area! With points! And I love her! Although George Michael had only got to second base, he\'d gone in head first, like Pete Rose. It\'s a jetpack, Michael. What could possibly go wrong? I\'m gonna build me an airport, put my name on it. Why, Michael? So you can fly away from your feelings? Why are you squeezing me with your body? It\'s a hug, Michael. I\'m hugging you",
